## Introduction to Project
This README file contains information about the project work from the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data". 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate students' ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

In this project, student is expected to demonstrate the following. Create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

## Steps
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Description about the raw data and the tidy data is in the Code Book.md
